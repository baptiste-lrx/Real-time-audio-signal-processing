# Real-time-audio-signal-processing
The idea behind the project is to enable real-time processing of the audio signal, which is supposed to come from a platform like Spotify, Deezer or something like that. The signal is to be broken down into harmonics, resulting in a realistic, human-playable piano score in real time.
